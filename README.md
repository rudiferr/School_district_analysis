# "school_district_analysis" Week 4 Challenge
### Tools Used
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Pandas

## Overview of the School District Analysis
<!--- Explain the purpose of this analysis. --->
The purpose of this analysis is to correct the statistics that were generated by having inaccurate data for the ninth graders at Thomas High School. By adjusting the dataframes, we will be able to anaylze different metrics such as: total school budget, per student capita, and average test scores & passing rates of different grade levels.

## Results
<!--- Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools? --->

Even though removing an entire school building's metrics sounds like it can lead a dramatically large shift, the original analysis relatively remained the same. Though, this makes sense due to the large amount of data that we were given; if this was only comparing three schools we would see a huge change, but only removing a small portion of the data from a sample size of n = 15 schools would not skew the data. Below is the table from the original analysis, which includes the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School.

Shown below is the updated per school summary, and looking specifically at the Thomas High School row, the statistics did not change by a lot.

Because of this, this still makes Thomas High School competitive to other schools, and whatever academic dishonesty that could be discovered in an internal audit will find only affects individual people rather than the freshman class as a whole.

## Summary
<!--- Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type --->
The biggest changes that affect the school district analysis have to deal with pure count of students and any related statistics with that. Total number of students and also the total number of students recorded from Thomas High School all resulted in a decrease. Though, this may imply a decrease in averages across the board in our various comparisons (across spending, size, and type). Though, because Thomas High School's averages only resulted in a very insignificant change, this also means that the other averages are going to be minimally affected as well. If Thomas High School's averages were affected by multiple points of change, that would be understandably adjust the other comparisons, but in these cases the change was statistically insignificant.
