# "school_district_analysis" Week 4 Challenge
## Overview of the School District Analysis
<!--- Explain the purpose of this analysis. --->
The purpose of this analysis is to correct the statistics that were generated by having inaccurate data for the ninth graders at Thomas High School. By adjusting the dataframes, we will be able to anaylze different metrics such as: total school budget, per student capita, and average test scores & passing rates of different grade levels.

## Results
<!--- Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type --->
Even though removing an entire school building's metrics sounds like it can lead a dramatically large shift, the original analysis relatively remained the same. Though, this makes sense due to the large amount of data that we were given; if this was only comparing three schools we would see a huge change, but only removing a small portion of the data from a sample size of n = 15 schools would not skew the data. Below is the table from the original analysis, which includes the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School.

## Summary
